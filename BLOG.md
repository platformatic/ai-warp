# Introducing Platformatic AI Warp 1.0.0: The Ultimate AI Gateway for Modern Applications

**The future of AI integration is here, and it's built for scale.**

Today, we're thrilled to announce the official launch of **Platformatic AI Warp 1.0.0** ‚Äì the most comprehensive AI gateway solution that transforms how developers integrate multiple AI providers into their applications. After extensive development and real-world testing, we're ready to revolutionize AI development with a unified, scalable, and intelligent platform.

## The Problem We Solved

Building production-ready AI applications has been a nightmare. Developers face a maze of challenges:

- **Provider Lock-in**: Choosing one AI provider means being stuck with their limitations
- **Complex Integration**: Each provider has different APIs, authentication, and response formats
- **Reliability Issues**: No built-in fallback when your primary AI service goes down
- **Session Management**: Maintaining conversation context across requests is a headache
- **Scaling Bottlenecks**: Managing rate limits, timeouts, and connection pooling manually

Sound familiar? We've been there too.

## Enter AI Warp: Your AI Operations Command Center

Platformatic AI Warp isn't just another AI wrapper ‚Äì it's a complete AI operations platform that handles the complexity so you can focus on building great features.

### üîÑ **Seamless Session Resume**

Never lose conversation context again. AI Warp maintains perfect conversation continuity across service restarts, load balancer switches, and distributed deployments:

```typescript
// Resume any conversation instantly
const response = await client.ask({
  prompt: 'What did we discuss about AI safety?',
  sessionId: 'a81bc81b-cafe-4e5d-abff-90865d1e13b1'  // Continues exactly where you left off
})
```

### üåê **One API to Rule Them All**

Connect to OpenAI, DeepSeek, and Google Gemini through a single, unified interface. Switch between providers without changing a single line of application code:

```typescript
// Simple string format
models: ["openai:gpt-4", "gemini:gemini-2.0-flash", "deepseek:deepseek-chat"]

// Or detailed configuration
models: [
  {
    provider: 'openai',
    model: 'gpt-4o',
    limits: { maxTokens: 4000, rate: { max: 100, timeWindow: '1m' } }
  },
  {
    provider: 'gemini',
    model: 'gemini-2.0-flash',
    limits: { maxTokens: 8000 }
  }
]
```

### üîÑ **Intelligent Automatic Fallback**

When your primary model hits rate limits or fails, AI Warp automatically tries the next model in your chain. No more 5am alerts about broken AI features:

```typescript
// Configure automatic restoration after failures
restore: {
  rateLimit: '5m',        // Retry after 5 minutes
  timeout: '2m',          // Retry after 2 minutes
  providerError: '10m'    // Retry after 10 minutes
}
```

### üíæ **Enterprise-Grade Session Management**

Maintain conversation context effortlessly with built-in session storage. Choose between lightning-fast in-memory storage or distributed Valkey/Redis for multi-instance deployments:

```typescript
// Distributed session storage
storage: {
  type: 'valkey',
  valkey: {
    host: 'localhost',
    port: 6379,
    database: 0
  }
}
```

#### How Valkey Session Storage Works

AI Warp's Valkey integration provides enterprise-grade session management through a sophisticated distributed storage architecture:

```mermaid
graph TB
    LB[Load Balancer] --> A1
    LB --> A2
    
    subgraph "AI Warp Service Instance 1"
        A1[Client Request] --> B1[AI Provider]
        B1 --> C1[History Manager]
        C1 --> D1[ValkeyStorage]
    end
    
    subgraph "AI Warp Service Instance 2"
        A2[Client Request] --> B2[AI Provider]
        B2 --> C2[History Manager]
        C2 --> D2[ValkeyStorage]
    end
    
    subgraph "LLM Providers"
        OpenAI[OpenAI]
        Gemini[Gemini]
        DeepSeek[DeepSeek]
        Others[(...)]
    end
    
    B1 --> OpenAI
    B1 --> Gemini
    B1 --> DeepSeek
    B1 --> Others
    B2 --> OpenAI
    B2 --> Gemini
    B2 --> DeepSeek
    B2 --> Others
    
    V1[(Valkey Database)]
    
    D1 --> V1
    D2 --> V1
    
    subgraph "Session Data"
        S1[Session ID: sess_abc123]
        S2[List: conversation_history]
        S3["{prompt: 'Hello', response: 'Hi there!'}"]
        S4["{prompt: 'How are you?', response: 'I'm doing well'}"]
    end
    
    V1 -.-> S1
    S1 --> S2
    S2 --> S3
    S2 --> S4
    
    style A1 fill:#e1f5fe
    style A2 fill:#e1f5fe
    style V1 fill:#f3e5f5
    style S1 fill:#e8f5e8
    style S2 fill:#e8f5e8
```

**Key Features:**
- **Distributed State**: Sessions are immediately available across all service instances
- **Automatic Expiration**: Configurable TTL prevents memory bloat (`historyExpiration: '1d'`)
- **JSON Serialization**: Efficient storage of conversation history with Redis Lists
- **Connection Pooling**: Optimized connection management with automatic reconnection
- **Cross-Instance Continuity**: Users can continue conversations on any instance

**Session Lifecycle:**
1. **Session Creation**: Auto-generated unique session ID (`a81bc81b-cafe-4e5d-abff-90865d1e13b1`)
2. **History Storage**: Each conversation turn is stored as JSON in Redis Lists using `LPUSH`
3. **Context Retrieval**: Previous conversation retrieved with `LRANGE` for AI context
4. **Automatic Cleanup**: Sessions expire based on configured TTL (default: 24 hours)

#### Session Resume: Seamless Conversation Continuity

One of AI Warp's most powerful features is seamless session resumption. Here's how it works:

**Resume Flow:**
```typescript
// Client resumes conversation with existing session ID
const response = await client.ask({
  prompt: 'What did we discuss about earlier?',
  sessionId: 'a81bc81b-cafe-4e5d-abff-90865d1e13b1'  // Previously stored session ID
})
```

**Behind the Scenes:**
1. **Session Validation**: AI Warp validates the session ID exists in Valkey
2. **History Retrieval**: Complete conversation history is fetched using `LRANGE a81bc81b-cafe-4e5d-abff-90865d1e13b1 0 -1`
3. **Context Reconstruction**: Previous conversation turns are provided to the AI model as context
4. **Contextual Response**: AI responds with full awareness of previous conversation
5. **History Update**: New conversation turn is added to the existing session

**Cross-Instance Resume:**
- User starts conversation on Instance A
- Session stored in shared Valkey cluster
- User's next request hits Instance B
- Instance B seamlessly retrieves full conversation history
- Response maintains perfect conversation continuity

**Error Handling:**
- Invalid session IDs return clear error messages
- Expired sessions gracefully start new conversations
- Storage failures fallback to stateless operation

This architecture enables true horizontal scaling - add more AI Warp instances without losing conversation state, and users can seamlessly continue conversations regardless of which instance handles their request.

### üåä **Real-Time Streaming**

Deliver instant, responsive AI experiences with Server-Sent Events (SSE) streaming:

```typescript
const client = buildClient({ url: 'http://localhost:3042' })

for await (const chunk of client.ask({ 
  prompt: 'Write a story about AI', 
  stream: true 
})) {
  console.log(chunk.content) // Real-time response chunks
}
```
